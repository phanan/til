* that the word "piggy" in "pigg bank" originates from _pygg_, an orange colored clay commonly used during the Middle Ages as a cheap material for pots to store money. Over time, these types of jars disappeared, but the word combination remained. Soon “pygg” turned into ”pig," and people started making piggy banks shaped like pigs.
