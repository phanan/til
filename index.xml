      <description> that one of Apple&amp;rsquo;s goals with every OS update is to break libraries and make developers suffer of BackBlaze, a (seems to be) great S3-alternative and good candidate for Koel&amp;rsquo;s next integration of scroll-behavior, a new CSS property to define whether the browser should jump (auto) or smoothly scroll to an anchored location that support for CSS variables (aka &amp;ldquo;custom properties&amp;rdquo;) is pretty decent now, which also means I should start using them, lest I get lagged behind of &amp;ldquo;Culture add &amp;gt; culture fit&amp;rdquo;, quoting @Una, a saying so awesome that GitLab added it into their handbook  </description>

      <description> that placebo, or the &amp;ldquo;make-believe medicine,&amp;rdquo; got its name from Latin placēbō, which means &amp;ldquo;I shall please,&amp;rdquo; and has nothing to do with places or time that Iced Earth&amp;rsquo;s album Something Wicked This Way Comes got its name from &amp;ldquo;something wicked this way comes,&amp;rdquo; part of a line from Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s Macbeth that the name Iced Earth was suggested to Jon Schaffer (guitarist) by his childhood best friend Bill Blackmon, who would later die in a motorbike accident, which then went on to inspire the song Watching Over Me  </description>
